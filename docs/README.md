### Note: Be sure to not have numpad keys binded in-game.

## Privacy and Security

This app uses a global keyboard hook to detect numpad presses for macros.
It does not record keystrokes, store typed text, or send data over the network.
Macros can be enabled or disabled from the UI and the system tray.
